#  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Description

#### Variables in the dataset

Age, sex, bmi, region, children, region, 
smoker: whether the individual is a smoker or not, 
charges: the cost of insurance for the individual.

### Steps followed

* Check the shape of the dataset to determine the number of rows and columns
* Check for missing values and handle them appropriately
* Check the data types of the variables to ensure they are in the correct format
* Summarize the statistics of the numerical variables
* Visualize the distribution of the variables using histograms, density plots, and box plots
* Check the relationship between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrix
* Check the distribution of the categorical variables using bar plots and pie charts.

### Insights gained after the analysis

* The shape of the dataset is: (1338, 7) and Missing values: 0 :- it means that there are no missing values and it contains 1338 rows and 7 columns where each row of the dataset contains values for all 7 variables 
* Having no missing values is a good thing as it makes it easier to analyze and draw insights from the data.
* Age: The age of the customers ranges from 18 to 64 with a mean of 39 years. The standard deviation of age is 14 years, indicating that the ages are spread out over a large range.

* BMI: The BMI of the customers ranges from 15.96 to 53.13 with a mean of 30.66. The standard deviation of BMI is 6.10, indicating that the BMIs are also spread out over a large range.

* Children: The customers have between 0 to 5 children with a mean of 1.09. The standard deviation of children is 1.21, indicating that there is a large variation in the number of children.

* Charges: The charges for insurance range from 1121.87 to 63770.43 with a mean of 13270.42. The standard deviation of charges is 12110.01, indicating that there is a large variation in charges for insurance.

### conclusion

* The exploratory data analysis suggests that there is a wide range of values for each numerical variable, indicating that there may be significant differences among customers.

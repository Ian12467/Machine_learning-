# Linear regression

### Mnemonics

* MAE - The Mean Absolute Error
* RMSE - Root Mean Squared Error
* MSE - Mean Squared Error

## Steps

* Import training models from sklearn and math module.
* Load the data.
* Split data for training and testing sets.
* Fit the linear regression model on the training data.
* predict charges on test data.
* Evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and MSE.
